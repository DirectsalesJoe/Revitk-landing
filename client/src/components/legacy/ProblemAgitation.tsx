      <div className="space-y-8">
        <p>One week passes. Two weeks. A month.</p>
        <p>You follow up. Your rep follows up.</p>
        <p><em>"Still under review. They said they'd get back to us."</em></p>
        <p>Another week. Still nothing.</p>
        <p><em>"They've gone quiet. Not sure what happened."</em></p>

        <p className="font-bold text-2xl text-brand-dark">You know exactly what happened.</p>

        <p>Your champion went to the CFO with your proposal.</p>
        
        <p>The CFO asked: <em>"What's the ROI? How does this compare to what we're doing now? What's the implementation timeline? What are the risks?"</em></p>

        <p>Your champion had your <span className="font-bold bg-yellow-100 px-1">standard pitch deck.</span></p>

        <p>The CFO glanced at it and said: <em>"Great. But who's going to do the work? How much time will this take from IT? What happens if it doesn't work? And why should I believe you can actually deliver this?"</em></p>

        <p>Your champion had no answer.</p>

        <p className="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl border-l-4 border-brand-accent pl-6 py-2 bg-gray-50 my-8">
          Because your pitch deck doesn't address any of that.
        </p>

        <p>It shows numbers on a page. Features. Case studies.</p>

        <p>
          But it doesn't address <span className="font-bold text-brand-accent">return on EFFORT.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          It doesn't address the <span className="font-bold">sacrifice</span> required from internal teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          It doesn't address the <span className="font-bold">political resistance</span> from the IT manager who doesn't give a damn about your ROI when his team is already stretched thin.
        </p>

        <p>
          It doesn't address the <span className="font-bold">credibility gap</span>: <em>"Why should we believe you'll deliver on these promises?"</em>
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold text-2xl mt-12">And that's what kills the deal.</p>
        <p>Not the numbers. The effort. The risk. The believability.</p>
        <p>Your champion couldn't handle those objections because you didn't give them the tools to handle them.</p>
        <p>So the deal died.</p>
        <p>And you're left wondering: <em>"They said they loved it. What the hell went wrong?"</em></p>

        <div className="h-12"></div>

        <p className="font-bold text-xl">Here's what else is happening:</p>
        <p>You (or your team) send proposals and then... wait.</p>
        <p>You send the quote. You follow up once. Twice. Three times.</p>
        <p><em>"Still reviewing it internally."</em></p>
        <p>Translation: <span className="font-bold">It's sitting in someone's inbox, forgotten.</span></p>
        <p>Because you didn't walk them through it. You didn't handle objections. You didn't create urgency or lock in next steps.</p>
        <p>You just sent it over and hoped it would come back.</p>

        <div className="py-12 text-center">
          <p className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold text-brand-dark">It won't.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Your quotes aren't boomerangs. They don't come back on their own.</p>
        <p>Prospects don't want to make decisions. They want to be <span className="font-bold">led</span> through a process.</p>
        <p>Your job is to make it easy for them to say yes.</p>
        <p>But if you just chuck the proposal over and say <em>"have a look and let me know,"</em> of course they're not going to come back.</p>
        <p>Of course they can't articulate it to the MD.</p>
        <p>Of course they can't explain the ROI <em>and the effort</em> to the CFO.</p>

        <p className="font-bold text-xl">You didn't make it easy. So they did nothing.</p>

        <div className="h-16"></div>
      </div>
    </section>
