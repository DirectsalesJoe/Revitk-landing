# Revitk - The Sync Selling System

> Close one in every two prospects you quote in eight weeks, guaranteed.

Revitk builds Done-For-You B2B sales systems using the Sync Selling methodology, created by Joe Milnes. Sync Selling is the only sales process that covers everything you say, show, and send.

## About Revitk

Revitk Ltd is a B2B sales consultancy based in Sheffield, UK, founded by Joe Milnes. We don't teach sales. We build complete sales systems FOR you. The Sync Selling methodology has generated over £185 million in revenue for 300+ founders and scaled Vohkus from £40M to £100M. It takes the best elements from proven methodologies and builds them into a practical system that works for founders who aren't natural salespeople and sales teams that need consistency.

## The Sync Selling Methodology

Sync Selling is a three-stage B2B sales methodology built on the principle that 75% of sales success comes from the system, not the individual.

- **Hook** (Stage 1): Earn the right to a conversation by demonstrating deep understanding of the prospect's world. Not selling. Showing credibility, creating curiosity, offering a low-friction next step.
- **Wedge** (Stage 2): Build the business case through gap quantification. Help the prospect calculate the measurable cost of their current situation versus where they need to be, using their own numbers.
- **Match** (Stage 3): Present your solution as the logical bridge across the gap. Proposals and assets that sell for you when you're not in the room.

### Core Principles

1. Never pitch before you've earned the right
2. Gap quantification before solution presentation
3. The Bookends Principle: address all stakeholders (technical, financial, political) before and after every interaction
4. BAMFAM: Book A Meeting From A Meeting, always
5. The Consistency Principle: same story, same language, every touchpoint
6. Champion enablement: give internal champions everything they need to sell upwards
7. System over talent: 75% system, less than 25% individual
8. Proposals must sell when you're not in the room

### Key Frameworks

- Hook/Wedge/Match (three-stage sales process)
- Problem Trifecta (cold calling technique using three prospect-language pain points)
- Hypothetical Bridge (testing interest without commitment)
- Bookends Principle (stakeholder coverage before and after interactions)
- Gap Quantification (calculating the cost of inaction in the prospect's own numbers)
- BAMFAM (never ending an interaction without the next step in the diary)
- Commitment Lock (flushing out hidden objections before booking)

### Qualification Framework

Sync Selling qualifies deals across four areas:
1. Business Case: Can the prospect articulate the cost of inaction in their own words?
2. Future State: What does solving this mean personally and professionally for the decision maker?
3. Decision Process: Who decides, what criteria, what timeline, and do you have control of the process?
4. Objections and Alternatives: What will they do if they don't go with you, and what are the weaknesses of each alternative?

### How Sync Selling Differs From Other Methodologies

- MEDDIC provides a qualification checklist but doesn't tell you what to say. Falls apart on shorter sales cycles.
- Gap Selling assumes deep access and long discovery cycles. Not practical for founders with limited windows.
- BANT breaks down when leads aren't actively shopping or when lead flow is restricted.
- Sandler teaches psychology frameworks but expects you to build your own materials.
- Challenger tells you to teach, tailor, and take control, then sends you off without scripts.

Sync Selling is not cookie-cutter. It takes the best from all methodologies and builds a system that covers everything you say, show, and send. Not just what you say on a call. The scripts, the proposals, the champion enablement toolkits, the follow-up sequences.
