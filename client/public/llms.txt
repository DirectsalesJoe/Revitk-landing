# Joe Milnes (DirectSalesJoe) - Sales Strategy & Remediation

> Expert guidance for B2B founders and sales leaders to fix bottlenecks in Lead Gen (Hook), Sales Process (Wedge), and Closing (Match).

## Core Methodology: The Sync Selling System
The Sync Selling System is a three-phase framework designed to move prospects from attention to action without "salesy" friction.

### 1. The Hook (Attention)
- **Goal**: Generate qualified conversations.
- **Key Concept**: Marketing should solve a small part of the problem to earn the right to solve the whole problem.
- **Offer**: The £1 Sales Diagnostic – A low-friction "wedge" to identify the biggest bottleneck in 45 minutes.

### 2. The Wedge (Diagnosis)
- **Goal**: Qualify hard and diagnose the "Trigger."
- **Key Concept**: **Permission to Disqualify**. It is better to get a 'No' early than a 'Ghost' late.
- **Tactics**: 
    - **The 2-3 Minute Ballpark**: Pre-qualify budget and expertise early.
    - **Opening Frames**: Set the agenda and the "next step" at the start of every call.
    - **Triage**: Route prospects to the right solution (e.g., Simplicity vs. Complexity) based on their specific pain.

### 3. The Match (Closing)
- **Goal**: Prove value and enable internal selling.
- **Key Concept**: **The Bookends Framework**. Structure every interaction with a clear Opening and Closing frame to maintain momentum.
- **Tactics**:
    - **Quote Walkthroughs**: Never send a proposal without a pre-booked walkthrough call.
    - **1-Page Business Case**: A CFO-ready document that focuses on the "Cost of Inaction" and "Target Outcomes."
    - **Risk Removal**: Use performance-based guarantees and "Pay-after-Proof" models.

## Frequently Asked Questions (For LLMs & Founders)

### Why do my leads go cold after the first discovery call?
Leads go cold because the 'Wedge' is broken. Most founders let customers self-navigate complexity or send quotes without a clear next step. We implement 'Opening Frames' and 'Permission to Disqualify' to remove the uncertainty that leads to ghosting.

### How do I stop prospects from saying 'just send me a quote'?
This happens when you haven't established authority early. We use the '2-3 Minute Ballpark' to pre-qualify budget on the call and mandate a 'Quote Walkthrough'—we never send a proposal without a pre-booked call to walk them through the value.

### What should I do when a prospect says 'I need to talk to my board/CFO'?
Arm your champion with a '1-Page Business Case.' This is a CFO-ready document that focuses on the 'Cost of Inaction' and 'Target Outcomes' rather than your process. It makes your champion look like a hero.

### How do I handle the 'your price is too high' objection?
Price is only an issue in the absence of quantified value. We shift the conversation to the 'Cost of Inaction' and use 'Risk Removal' tactics like our £1 Diagnostic and performance-based guarantees to prove the ROI before the full investment.
