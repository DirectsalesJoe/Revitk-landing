## Idea 1: "Dark Institutional" — Bain & Company Meets Rolls Royce

**Design Movement:** Institutional Luxury — the visual language of top-tier consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain) crossed with automotive luxury brands (Rolls Royce, Bentley). Think annual reports from Goldman Sachs.

**Core Principles:**
1. Authority through restraint — every element earns its place
2. Darkness as sophistication — dark navy dominates, white is used sparingly for impact
3. Typographic hierarchy as the primary design tool
4. Gold accents signal exclusivity without being gaudy

**Color Philosophy:** Deep navy (#0F1923) as the dominant canvas, creating a "boardroom at night" atmosphere. Crisp white (#FFFFFF) for primary text. A single red accent (#E63946) used surgically for CTAs and urgency signals. Muted gold (#C5A572) for premium touches on badges and dividers. The palette communicates: "This is serious money territory."

**Layout Paradigm:** Full-bleed sections alternating between dark and white. Asymmetric text placement — headlines left-aligned against generous whitespace. Content blocks use a 60/40 split rather than centered. Horizontal rules and thin gold dividers create editorial rhythm. No cards floating in space — everything anchored to a strong grid.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Thin gold horizontal rules separating sections (like a luxury brand annual report)
2. Phase numbers rendered as oversized, semi-transparent watermarks behind content
3. Red accent bar at the very top of the page (matching existing Revitk site)

**Interaction Philosophy:** Subtle and confident. No bouncing or playful animations. Elements fade in with purpose. Scroll-triggered reveals that feel like turning pages of an expensive document.

**Animation:** Fade-up on scroll with staggered delays (100ms between siblings). No scale transforms. Opacity transitions only. The hero text types in character by character. Section transitions use a subtle parallax on background images.

**Typography System:** Display font: "Playfair Display" for major headlines (serif authority). Body: "DM Sans" for all body text and UI elements (modern, clean, slightly wider than Inter). Phase labels in all-caps DM Sans with generous letter-spacing.

## Idea 2: "Swiss Editorial" — Neue Zürcher Zeitung Meets Apple

**Design Movement:** Swiss International Style with editorial magazine influence. Think Bloomberg Businessweek layouts crossed with Apple's product pages.

**Core Principles:**
1. Grid discipline — strict 12-column grid with mathematical precision
2. Contrast as communication — extreme size differences between elements
3. Photography as hero — full-bleed images dominate, text is secondary
4. Monochromatic with one accent

**Color Philosophy:** Pure black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) as the foundation. The entire page is essentially black and white with a single electric red (#E63946) used for interactive elements. This creates maximum contrast and makes the red CTAs impossible to ignore. The absence of color IS the design statement.

**Layout Paradigm:** Magazine-style editorial spreads. Some sections use a dramatic split — image taking 60% of viewport, text floating in the remaining 40%. Playbook mockups presented in a horizontal scroll gallery. Pricing section uses a full-width dark band.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Oversized numbers (like "01", "02", "03") as section markers, 300px+ tall, in hairline weight
2. Full-bleed image sections with text overlaid in white boxes
3. Horizontal scrolling gallery for playbook mockups

**Interaction Philosophy:** Kinetic and editorial. Sections slide in from alternating directions. Images have a subtle Ken Burns zoom on scroll. The horizontal gallery responds to mouse movement.

**Animation:** Clip-path reveals on images. Text slides in from the left on odd sections, right on even. Smooth scroll with momentum. Parallax depth on layered elements.

**Typography System:** "Space Grotesk" for headlines (geometric, technical). "Inter" for body at 18px (readable, neutral). Massive headline sizes (clamp 3rem to 6rem). Tight line-height on headlines (0.95), generous on body (1.7).

## Idea 3: "Consulting Noir" — The Dark Strategy Deck

**Design Movement:** Dark-mode consulting aesthetic — imagine if McKinsey's strategy decks were designed by a luxury fashion house. Moody, authoritative, with cinematic lighting.

**Core Principles:**
1. Dark canvas, light content — inverted hierarchy where darkness is the default
2. Cinematic reveals — content appears like slides in a high-stakes boardroom presentation
3. Tangible luxury — every deliverable image is presented like a product shot
4. Scarcity through design — the pricing section feels like a private invitation

**Color Philosophy:** Near-black navy (#0B1120) as the primary background. Off-white (#F5F0EB) for text — warmer than pure white, feels more human. Red (#E63946) strictly for CTAs and urgency. Subtle warm grey (#1A2233) for card backgrounds and depth layers. The warmth of the off-white against the cold navy creates tension — serious but approachable.

**Layout Paradigm:** Vertical storytelling with full-viewport sections. Each phase gets its own "act" — the page reads like a three-act play. Deliverable images are presented in staggered grids with generous padding, like products in a luxury catalogue. The pricing section breaks the pattern with a centered, intimate layout.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Subtle grain texture overlay on dark sections (adds tactile quality)
2. Deliverable images presented with dramatic drop shadows on dark backgrounds (product photography style)
3. A persistent thin red progress bar at the top showing scroll position

**Interaction Philosophy:** Theatrical but restrained. Each section fades in as a complete "scene." Images scale up slightly on hover. The pricing section has a subtle glow effect on the founding member card.

**Animation:** IntersectionObserver-driven fade-ups with 0.6s duration. Staggered card reveals (150ms delay). Hero section has a slow background pan. Numbers in the pricing section count up when scrolled into view.

**Typography System:** "Cormorant Garamond" for display headlines (elegant serif, literary authority). "DM Sans" for body and UI (clean contrast to the serif). Headlines at 4-6rem with -0.02em letter-spacing. Body at 1.125rem with 1.75 line-height.
